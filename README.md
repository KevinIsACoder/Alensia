# Alensia

A high level framework to build RPG style games using Unity3D engine.

## Motivation

I just started to learn C# and Unity3D to create my own game, but couldn't get used 
to the way it's supposed to be done.

So, I decided to create everything from the scratch in my own way.   

## Dependencies

It uses [Zenject](https://github.com/modesttree/Zenject), a dependency injection framework for Unity3D.

## Status

It's in a very very very early stage of development. So don't even think about 
actually using it for anything.

## FAQ

> What is 'Alensia' anyway?

Sorry, I have no idea. The name just came up to my mind.

> Isn't there everything you need on Asset Store already? Are you really that 
poor so you can't affford to buy anything?

Let's just say I'm so arrogant that I can't stand to look at any code other 
people wrote.

Besides that, there are not many options if you want to make an open source 
game, as only a few items on Asset Store supports such an usage.

> So, it's just a framework then? Where's the real game?

I'm planning to create one based on this framework, but haven't decided what 
exactly would it be yet. So I just decided to create a generic framework first, 
so I can build upon it later.

> When can I expect to see it finished, or at least become remotely usable?

Maybe in next 10 years? (I hope Unity will still be there then.)
